    Hello, I am Russell. I am passionate about data security, especially after seeing recent data leaks resulting in huge problems. I used to think that Cybersecurity wasn't for me, but I am very moved about my data security and other people's data security. 

Some of the core strengths that I have currently is Programming, and I'm passionate about data security. Some of the values that I have is again that I really want to have data secure, and I want to learn new methods to keep that data secure. I am interested in data security, this is for employers to look at and see that I am trying. My goals align with organizations because they don't want customers' data leaked, and i don't want my data leaked.
